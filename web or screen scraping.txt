Many times data is scraped from multiple sources
Data can be taken out in tabular or json format
we can inspect a web page to get data by right clicking on a page
select has the options
we need to use one of them to make a reqeuest
There's a class attribute for the table which helps in parsing tables made in html

build lists of options
make http requests to download all data
then parse the data files
We work in this way so that we work with data we don't want to change
After cleaning we may get dirty data meaning a bug in the parser
Static data will make it easier to find the bug
Retrieve the data only once as data does not change for other pieces of data
