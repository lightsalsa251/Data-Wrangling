We can parse XML data by ElementTree
There are two ways to parse a xml document
1) By file name
2) As a string value

nodename	Selects all nodes with the name "nodename"
/	Selects from the root node
//	Selects nodes in the document from the current node that match the selection no matter where they are
.	Selects the current node
..	Selects the parent of the current node
@	Selects attributes


bookstore	Selects all nodes with the name "bookstore"
/bookstore	Selects the root element bookstore
Note: If the path starts with a slash ( / ) it always represents an absolute path to an element!

bookstore/book	Selects all book elements that are children of bookstore
//book	Selects all book elements no matter where they are in the document
bookstore//book	Selects all book elements that are descendant of the bookstore element, no matter where they are under the bookstore element
//@lang	Selects all attributes that are named lang

*	Matches any element node
@*	Matches any attribute node
node()	Matches any node of any kind

/bookstore/book[1]	Selects the first book element that is the child of the bookstore element.
