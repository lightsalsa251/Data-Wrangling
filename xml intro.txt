If we want citations of a paper we can easily take its data in .xml format
xml has encoded data that can be used for programming purposes
like if we want to see bibliography than it will be present in a tag related to its name

XML was designed for:
1) Data Transfer
There is no platform dependency
2) Easy to write code for reading and writing
3) Document Validation by providing a specification then all other data can be checked against it
4) Human Readable
5) Supports wide variety of Apps

XML standard 
robust parsers
we can focus on our analysis
its free and does not changes

XML information can be modified programmatically
It can be converted to other formats losslessly
In XML data is stored as a key:value pair but some may store data as documents as well

In XML elements are the basic building blocks
<num>2342</num>
there are nested elements
Data can as document type
<title>this is a course</title>
Data can also be stored like
<tag k="addr:housenumber" v="1040"/>
This is a key:value pair

There are attributes associated with elements like
<node id="1" version="2">
<tag ... />
<tag ... />
</node>
here id and version are attributes
Data of an element is in its attributes here
But in these type of data there may be missing values

In XML, the attribute values must always be quoted.

This will generate an XML error:

<message>salary < 1000</message>
To avoid this error, replace the "<" character with an entity reference:

<message>salary &lt; 1000</message>
There are 5 pre-defined entity references in XML:

&lt;	<	less than
&gt;	>	greater than
&amp;	&	ampersand 
&apos;	'	apostrophe
&quot;	"	quotation mark
Only < and & are strictly illegal in XML, but it is a good habit to replace > with &gt; as well.

The syntax for writing comments in XML is similar to that of HTML.

<!-- This is a comment -->

Two dashes in the middle of a comment are not allowed.

Not allowed:

<!-- This is a -- comment -->
Strange, but allowed:

<!-- This is a - - comment -->

XML does not truncate multiple white-spaces
Windows applications store a new line as: carriage return and line feed (CR+LF).
