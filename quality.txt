wrangling/hacking->gathering, extracting, cleaning and storing the data
Mongodb gets the ready 
There are probelems with our data

Assessing the quality of data->
We need to assess our data in to:
test assumptions about
values
data types
shapes

We also need to identify errors or outliers
Finally we need to assess the data for missing values and will our data support the queries we need to make


Tabular Formats->
What items/rows a dataset contains and what fields/coloumns do they have
First row mostly will be the name of these fields

tabular data is stored in csv files as scv files are very lightweight, each line is a single row, fields are
separated by a delimeter usually a comma(there are tsv files with delimeter a tab character), stores only the data,
there is no need for special purpose programs to run it, all csv files can be run on a spreadsheet.

Open a big csv file in a excel sheet might be slow so we load it into a python dictionary

We don't notice the garbage white space characters around the values which make a big difference when it comes to comparisons, we can remove them by the strip
function.
